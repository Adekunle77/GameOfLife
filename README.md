# Game Of Life

### Playing
First select cells on grid, then press start.

### Development
The project was developed using Swift programming lanuage, and the SpriteKit framework. 

### Notes 
I wrote a few Unit test. Also I was going to add a model for the GameScene class, to keep most of the logic out of the GameScene class. 

### Apologies 
There is small delays after, pressing buts and for next steps in the game.
